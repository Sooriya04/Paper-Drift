### feat: initialize paper-drift npm package, zero-chromium cli, and wasm pipeline
**Technical Summary:**
- Restructured workspace into a modular npm package (`paper-drift`) with `src/`, `bin/cli.js`, and standardized file headers.
- Implemented zero-Chromium CLI and ESM programmatic API using the MuPDF WebAssembly engine (`convertPdfToHtml`).
- Built dual-layer high-DPI rasterization and selectable HTML text overlay with configurable scales, bounds, and page filtering.
- Reorganized client-side playground with browser WASM execution, progress tracking, live DOM preview, and standalone file export.
- Configured automated GitHub Actions CI testing matrix across Node.js versions and authored architecture guidelines (`AGENT.md`).

### fix(ci): track package-lock.json to resolve actions cache failure
**Technical Summary:**
- Removed `package-lock.json` from `.gitignore` to track lockfile for reproducible CI builds.
- Regenerated `package-lock.json` matching `paper-drift` package identity.
- Enabled GitHub Actions npm cache resolution in `actions/setup-node@v4`.
- Updated CI install step to use `npm ci --ignore-scripts` for fast, deterministic dependency installs.
